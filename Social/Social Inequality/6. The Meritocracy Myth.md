## Summary
---
- There are many different forms of discrimination that still exist today. This makes America an uneven playing field for those who were unaware
- Most of these forms are no longer explicit and instead are implicit forms of discrimination such as lack of sponsorship (Women’s mobility) or preserving previous forms of discrimination (redlining and housing)

- Effectively this chapter “covers the loose ends” so to speak when it comes to the discussion of discrimination. It talks about a wide variety of discrimination types in a very brief form and summarizes their affect
- I think one thing missing from these discussions though are the economic implications which are thought of and being analyzed in the rest of this class. How do those connect to these alternative forms of discrimination? Though that might be outside of the scope of the book

What are all of the things you would like to talk about with this paper?

Need to initially establish 

## Decision Systems
- - -
What are Decision Systems and where do they show up in our lives? Mainly talking about computerized ones
- Def: Systems which assist in making automatic decisions about something

- Human versions
	- [[6. The Meritocracy Myth|The Meritocracy Myth]]: Good old boys networks and mentorship relationships with women
	- 

- Computerized versions
	- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Ineqaulity]]: They show up in all three sections of this book
	- 

Why do they matter today?
- [[17. Oppression|Oppression]]: They are another layer where oppression and discrimination can occur
- 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">I think connecting how ignorance, either willful or generated, impacts decision systems and how they are upheld is a good idea and can make more content.</mark>
	<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Start with</mark> [[1. The Allegory of the Cave]]. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You can summarize it and then explain how ignorance instills fear in communities, especially rural white working class communities, that actually hurts them and allows them to be manipulated into willfully upholding decision systems that work against them. I think that</mark> [[25. Dying of Whiteness]] and [[6. The Meritocracy Myth]] could be good starting points.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Do you think that affirmative action could be something to discuss? It is mentioned in at least</mark> [[7.2 The Just World Fallacy]] <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">and can be connected to willful ignorance and confirmation bias being used to take advantage of people's natural psychology of wanting to believe that the world is fair and just and that everything happens to everyone for a reason, leading to victim blaming?</mark>
	[[9. Who Am I]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We see things through our own lenses instead of how they actually are - ignorance</mark>
## Interpretability
- - -
These engines need to be interpretable because we need to know why something is happening in order to make sense of it.
If you can't interpret a decision system's results and factors, it becomes much more prone to have an implicit cause and effect.
- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: Refer to the first story of this book
- [[8. Racial Domination, Racial Progress|Racial Domination]]: I think this is where redlining was outlined pretty well so this should serve as an intro to redlining
- [[6. The Meritocracy Myth|The Meritocracy Myth]]: Talk about how denials without reason can be ways of hiding discrimination and biased practices
	- How moving into a neighborhood is still related to redlining (White flight)
- [[17. Oppression|Oppresion]]: How systems like this can create barriers
- [[3. The Lottery|The Lottery]]: How without written meaning the importance can be lost with time and just "accepted"
I vs F: ability to reason why a decision was made by a decision system vs needing to be able to handle anyone, an impossible task - from a software perspective, it is hard to make a system be able to process everything about everyone. Finite cutoffs beyond which they are unable to do something
	redlining: direct, visible cause or factor in why or why not someone was able to move (I)
	AE: Medicaid in Indiana giving no reason for denial. As a part of that system, the person also has no way to figure out why they were denied. The customer service people did not know why someone was being denied; the system did not allow them to know the reasons (no I)
	AARP: you have to be old. An example of a hard cutoff. A system which is flexible does not give discrete ranges to cutoff. Hard cutoffs make it hard to account for everyone. DS which aim to account for everyone should be able to override these hard cutoffs and deviate from what everyone is given. There are ethical problems, since you are allowing for exceptions, and there is no easy way to determine if the exception is being applied appropriately.
## Accountability
- - -
Someone needs to be responsible for the decisions these engines make and how they make their decisions
- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: First story & possibly the second
- [[29. New Jim Crow|New Jim Crow]]: Police Brutality, and War on drugs (?)
	- There are also other articles we looked at in class that aren't tracked so you will be able to use those
<mark style="background: #008080;">- Who should be responsible?</mark>

## Flexibility
- - - 
These engines need to allow for 
- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: Talk about how the solutions were not flexible to address all of the situations
- Talk about identity and how hard it can be to "classify people"
	- [[9. Who Am I|Who Am I]]
	- [[5. Systems of Power and Inequality|Systems of Power and Inequality]]: Talks about how the prevaling systems are social constructions that change with time. You need the system to adapt to those changing definitions

## Feasibility
- - -
There's two kinds of feasibility in this case: economic, and logistical

Economic: How can we make systems like this reasonable to work with within the current economic system?
- [[30. Saving Capitalism|Saving Capitalism]]: How does the market organize itself into figuring out what can and can't be a product?

Logistical: Are rules and properties like this the right direction?
- [[30. Saving Capitalism|Saving Capitalism]]: Is the economy aligned to create more fair systems like this?
	- Most likely not due to how current enforcement is working out
- [[13. The White Working Class and Trump|The White Working Class and Trump]]: Are people willing to move forward with broader and larger policy changes?
	- Most likely not because of rampant belief in [[6. The Meritocracy Myth|The Meritocracy Myth]]

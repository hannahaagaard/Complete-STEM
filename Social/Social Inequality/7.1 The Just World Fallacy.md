## Summary
---
- <mark style="background: #008080;">People want to believe that things happen for a reason and that the world is fair, which can lead to victim blaming. A 2009 study found that Holocaust memorials can actually increase anti-Semitism.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">'Faced with injustice, we'll try to alleviate it - but, if we can't, we'll do the next best thing, psychologically speaking: blame the victims of the injustice'.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">People with a world view of general fairness are more likely to oppose things like affirmative action. They don't have to be explicitly hateful or racist. They are argued to be more likely to support politicians whose policies make things worse for the innocent people who are not perceived to be innocent, because if they're so innocent, then why are those bad things happening to them if the world is fair? If their world view is shattered, they'll basically have an existential crisis.  </mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Could argue about willful ignorance
	- Obvious echo chamber/ confirmation bias (inference)
	- Affirmative action could be an example of a decision system which actively tries to benefit groups previously affected by harmful decision systems, maybe can talk more about that</mark>

## Summary
---
- I think the point of this story is to express that the reasons for traditions can easily be lost over time
	- It’s mentioned several times throughout the story that the other aspects of the lottery have been lost because no one remembers them. It’s a pretty weird shift that only the final act of violence is actually upheld
- There is an aspect to this that because we forget the specific reasons for acts they either need to be documented as well as questioned if they are still relevant at any one particular time.
- I think based on the description of other villages doing away with the lottery that it’s becoming less relevant and important as time goes on
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can this be connected to</mark> [[2. A Cult of Ignorance]]?

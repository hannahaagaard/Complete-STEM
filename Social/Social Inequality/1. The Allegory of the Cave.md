## Summary
---
- I’ve heard most of the allegory of the cave before in it being a story about seeing the world truthfully. However, I hadn’t realized that there was a secondary meaning to it
- I see the secondary meaning in the latter pages of the story which convey that someone who has learned of the truths of the world should share them with those without the knowledge. Simply because he can discern better and impart reality more accurately into those who haven’t seen truth. Effectively saying that after learning someone should become a teacher who move people towards seeing the truth
	- I didn’t realize that this theme was a part of this story
	- Instead I focused on the ideas of reality being hidden in the causes behind the shadows and that seeing beyond them impossible. It’s an approach I try to take as a scientist but it feels more fundamental now after reading this

## Summary
---
- Effectively stating that a lot of the issues women experience aren’t a problem of an individual event but a collection of barriers
- Also creates an effective definition of oppressed as a system of barriers that limit/trap a group of people until they have a single choice
	- Double standards is a big part of this
- There is a difference between being oppressed and suffering. This is based around having a series of limitations placed instead of individual barriers
- Also need to look at who benefits from these barriers existing and who they are targeted to in order to identify oppression
- I wish that I had read this piece before reading the pieces on racism because I feel that this helps me model and contextualize a lot of systemic issues
- I think I have personal trouble identifying macroscopic issues unless directly told that they are. I wonder how I can identify those situations?
- Also reminds me of the microaggressions which are something that I’ve never really understood. It’s not the individual person or event, it’s the multitude.

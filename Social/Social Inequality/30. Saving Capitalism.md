## Summary
---
- The overall idea of this text is to argue that the free market does not really exist and instead the market is highly influenced by the politics governing it (through regulation and what forms are accepted)
- There are five different aspects of the market that he goes into which influence the market. These are the mechanisms which actually compose the market
	- Property 
	- Monopoly
	- Contract
	- Bankruptcy
	- Enforcement
- All of these aspects are inherently political in nature and are directly tied to those with money
- Since the Citizen’s United case these aspects have increasingly been under the influence of large corporations which defy the metrocratic myth of the US
- These systems largely work to change things to their advantage while still being within the realm of “legal” and “not corrupt”
	- A few examples of this are the increasing populations of working poor and non-working rich which receive bonuses beyond what they are worth
	- These individuals also have undue influence over politics through campaign donations and job security 
	- This job security can be viewed as a privilege that those with money enjoy because they have less concern over the certainty of their carrier. Of course the author was just talking about politicians but I have a suspicion that other jobs have this as well
		- Something to look into for sure
		- Also likely why DEI changes take so long to have an effect on the current situation. Benefits like these form a “good old boys” kind of network in the longer term
- He then starts to discuss counterbalancing systems which have been withering.
- One thing I’m noticing with the concepts in this class is that there are many examples of sometype of inequality being justified as a form of economy.
	- With mass incarceration there is now a business which gains by having people incarcerated
	- With slavery they were the tools to generate products
	- With modern examples it’s encoring systems of power that hurt the many

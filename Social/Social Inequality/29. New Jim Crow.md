## Summary
---
- This book outlines how the prison system acts as a new form of Jim Crow laws
	- Because it disproportionately affects Black and other minorities in the US
	- Because the punishments are not proportional to the crimes
	- Because of the origins of being “tough on crime”
	- Because of how felons are deprived of their rights after leaving prison
- This is an issue I’ve known about for a while because I’ve had people critical of the prison-industrial complex for a while
- It’s very interesting to see the idea of “racial bribing” and how that was used to encourage poor white people to go against slaves
	- I like this terminology and think it’s very apt to describe a “divide and conquer” strategy this way when turning people against each other
		- So I’d say that this also happens when looking at sexuality, gender, and masculinity but in slightly different forms
	- Each time the subjects and populations are just slightly different
	- Nice trick
- Also there is a related youtube piece at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqQa_0gM6hg&ab_channel=truTV
	- More on prison than mass incarceration but still related

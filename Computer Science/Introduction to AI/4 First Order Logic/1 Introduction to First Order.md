First order logic (Predicate logic) is an expansion on prepositional logic that allows for more expression. It's very hard to describe objects and their properties within prepositional logic because of the number of variables required. **Prepositional logic gets quite large with few objects**. I'm sure you've seen it if you've tried to do a few larger problems.

Because of this problem of lacking expression we need to expand our definitions in order to allow for something greater. This can be done by including the following definitions

1. Predicates
2. Objects
3. Functions
4. Quantifiers

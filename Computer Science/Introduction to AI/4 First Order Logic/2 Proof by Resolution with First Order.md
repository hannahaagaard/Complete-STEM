Overall the steps are pretty similar but there are some differences due to the existance of quantifiers. The general process is as follows
1. Remove Equivalences/Implications
2. Reduce the scope of all nots to a single term (De Morgan's Law)
3. Make all variable names unique (standardize apart)
4. Move quantifiers left (convert to prenex normal form)
5. Eliminate existential quantifiers (skolemization)
6. Eliminate universal quantifiers
7. Conver to conjunction of disjunctions
